      "description": "My name is Marni Hager. I'm a software developer with a background in manufacturing engineering for aerospace companies. As a manufacturing engineer, I have learned to optimize various types of processes, including mapping out the steps of a process and determining which are value added and which are waste. I have translated this into code in more recent years at my job by automating processes that were taking a full day into something that takes less than an hour. My current goal is to find a job that will allow me to combine my skills as a manufacturing engineer with being a programmer.",
